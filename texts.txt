Fake life through goggles
<br>Endless possiblities
<br>Unhealthy outcomes


Eyes lost in pixels
<br>Disconnected from the world
<br>Human touch fades fast


Worlds of falsehoods and ideal situations
<br>No thoughts of commitments and real obligations
<br>Living in your own world<br>As addiction takes hold
<br>
<br>No concept of time
<br>No sense of mind
<br>The allure is too strong
<br>Leave reality behind


In pixelated worlds we're trapped
<br>Human bonds by screens are snapped.
<br>Eyes strained in the artificial glow,
<br>As real connections cease to flow
<br>
<br>In digital confines, we reside,
<br>Humanity's essence begins to slide
